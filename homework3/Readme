The hy562_ex3.scala file contains the commands in order to run the excersize from the spark-shell (you have to include the AprioriAlgorithm).
This commands are NOT for the parallel varsion of apriori nor SON. In order to run the parallel version use the file in hw3 folder.

The hw3 folder contains a complete implementation of the algorithm ready to build using sbt (sbt package) and then submit the jar to the spark using spark-submit.
