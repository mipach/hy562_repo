The hy562_ex3.scala file contains the commands in order to run the excersize from the spark-shell (you have to include the AprioriAlgorithm).

The hw3 folder contains a complete implementation of the algorithm ready to build using sbt (sbt package) and then submit the jar to the spark using spark-submit.
